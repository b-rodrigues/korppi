## Step 1: Create Your First Document

2. The welcome screen invites you to configure your user profile (which you
   should, so people can put a face on an edit when you'll send them the
   document)
3. Click **New** in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+N`)
4. Start typing in the editor!
5. All your edits are automatically saves as *patches*

The editor uses **Markdown** formatting, so you can write naturally:

```markdown
# My Document Title

This is a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.

## A Section

- Bullet point one
- Bullet point two
- Bullet point three
```

## Step 2: Save Your Work

1. Click **Save** in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+S`)
2. Choose a location and filename
3. Your document is saved as a `.kmd` file
4. Send this `.kmd` file to colleagues: they will have access to the complete
   history of your file and can add their edits!

> **Tip:** Enable **Autosave** to automatically save every few minutes!

## Step 3: Format Your Text

### Using the Toolbar

The left sidebar has formatting buttons for:
- **B** - Bold
- *I* - Italic
- ~~S~~ - Strikethrough
- `Code` - Inline code
- H1/H2/H3 - Headings
- Lists, quotes, and more!

### Using Markdown

Just type markdown syntax directly:

| What you type | What you get |
|--------------|--------------|
| `**bold**` | **bold** |
| `*italic*` | *italic* |
| `# Heading` | Heading |
| `- item` | • item |
| `` `code` `` | `code` |

---

## Step 4: Use Context Menus

**Right-click** on selected text to see formatting options:
- Bold, Italic, Strikethrough
- Add links
- Copy, Search in document
- Add comments

**Right-click** without selection for:
- Paste
- Insert table, image, code block
- Select all

## Step 5: Explore the Timeline

The **Timeline** panel on the right shows your document's history:

1. Every significant change appears as a "patch"
2. Click a patch to preview that version
3. Use Preview/Restore to go back in time

As your colleagues send you their versions of the file, you will be able
to *reconcile* versions into one main document!

## Step 6: Reconcile versions

Clicking on "Reconcile" will prompt you to import all the different version
of the document into your current session. Doing so imports all the history
of your colleagues as patches into the timeline. You will then have
the possibility to accept or reject their changes.

## Step 6: Export Your Document

When you're ready to share:

1. Click **Export MD** to export as Markdown
2. Click **Export DOCX** to export as Word document
