## What is Korppi?

**Korppi** (Finnish for *raven*) is a text editor that tries to focus on one
problem, and one problem only: how to easily integrate changes from various
collaborators into a main document. It is meant for business users that aren’t
familiar with Git and use Microsoft Office’s *track changes* functionality for
asynchronous collaboration. It is meant for users that can't use real-time,
online-only services like Google Docs for privacy reasons or that cannot get
access to such a tool.

Unlike traditional editors, Korppi remembers **every change you make** and lets
you travel through time to see how your document evolved!

The idea is to first use Korppi to **just focus on the content** and gather
feedback and input from coworkers. Then, use Korppi's user-friendly
reconciliation features to merge all the input in the same document, **export to
Word format** and continue with the layout there!

Korppi is open-source, runs on your machine without the need to create an account,
register a credit card, no ads, no telemetry no nothing. It's just a simple
text editor, but with nice built-in features to easily reconcile documents!
