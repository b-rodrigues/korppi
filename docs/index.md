## What is Korppi?

**Korppi** (Finnish for "raven") is a powerful desktop markdown editor built for
writers, researchers, and technical authors who need more than just a text
editor.

Unlike traditional editors, Korppi remembers **every change you make** and lets
you travel through time to see how your document evolved!

Korppi is a text editor that tries to focus on one problem, and one problem
only: how to easily integrate changes from various collaborators into a main
document. It is meant for business users that aren’t familiar with Git and use
Microsoft Office’s *track changes* functionality for asynchronous collaboration.

The idea is to first use Korppi to **just focus on the content** and gather
feedback and input from coworkers. Then, use Korppi's user-friendly
reconciliation features to merge all the input in the same document, **export to
Word format** and continue with the layout there!
